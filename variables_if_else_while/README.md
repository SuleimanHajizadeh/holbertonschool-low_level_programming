## :eye: About

<br>

<div align="center">

**`C - variables, if, else, while`** theme focuses on fundamental programming concepts in C, including variable declaration and manipulation, conditional statements, and loop structures.
<br>
The programs illustrate these concepts by performing tasks like generating random numbers, printing alphabets, and creating number combinations.
<br>
<br>
This project has been created by **[Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/about-holberton)** to enable every student to understand how C language works.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tasks

<br>

**`0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing`**

**`1. The last digit`**

**`2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game`**

**`3. alphABET`**

**`4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off`**

**`5. Numbers`**

**`6. Numberz`**

**`7. Smile in the mirror`**

**`8. Hexadecimal`**

**`9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success`**

**`10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need`**

**`11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...`**

**`12. Software is eating the World`**

## :computer: Requirements

<br>

```diff

General

+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

+ All your files should end with a new line

+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project

+ There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation

- You are not allowed to use system

+ Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

```

<br>

**_Why all your files should end with a new line? See [HERE](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789)_**
