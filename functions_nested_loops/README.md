## :eye: About

<br>

<div align="center">

**`C - functions, nested loops`** theme introduces fundamental concepts of function definitions and the use of loops in C programming.
<br>
The programs contain implementations of various functions that perform tasks such as printing characters and numbers, checking character types, performing basic arithmetic operations, and creating complex patterns using nested loops.
<br>
<br>
This project has been created by **[Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/about-holberton)** to enable every student to understand how C language works.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tasks

<br>

**`0. _putchar`**

**`1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game`**

**`2. 10 x alphabet`**

**`3. islower`**

**`4. isalpha`**

**`5. Sign`**

**`6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you`**

**`7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important`**

**`8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life`**

**`9. Learn your times table`**

**`10. a + b`**

**`11. 98 Battery Street, the OG`**

**`12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself`**

**`13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women`**

**`14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.`** <br>
**`    Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A`**

**`15. Even Liber Abbaci`**

**`16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.`** <br>
**`    Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+`**

## :memo: Learning Objectives

<br>

**_You are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google:_**

<br>

```diff

General

+ What are nested loops and how to use them

+ What is a function and how do you use functions

+ What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function

+ What is a prototype

+ Scope of variables

+ What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89

+ What are header files and how to to use them with #include

```

<br>
<br>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## :computer: Requirements

<br>

```diff

General

+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

+ All your files should end with a new line

+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

+ Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

- You are not allowed to use global variables

+ No more than 5 functions per file

- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden

+ You are allowed to use _putchar

- You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

+ In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. <br> You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). <br> We will use our own main.c files at compilation. <br> Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

+ The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

+ Don’t forget to push your header file

```

<br>

**_Why all your files should end with a new line? See [HERE](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789)_**

<br>
<br>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## :keyboard: More Info

<br>

- You do not have to understand the **call by reference (address)**, **stack**, **static variables**, **recursions** or **arrays**, yet.
